APP QUIZ

This is a simple quiz application that helps to test your user's knowledge, create engagement, and guide users.

Technologies Used

I've used HTML, CSS, and JS. The JS plays the main role and I've taken the local data as JSON Format. If you want to use API source data as an input, then use the Fetch method to get the JSON data from the API source and then feed that data as input.
